# Code Review Plugin

Automated code review for pull requests using multiple specialized agents with confidence-based scoring to filter false positives.

## Overview

The Code Review Plugin automates pull request review by launching multiple agents in parallel to independently audit changes from different perspectives. It uses confidence scoring to filter out false positives, ensuring only high-quality, actionable feedback is posted.

## Commands

### `/code-review`

Performs automated code review on a pull request using multiple specialized agents.

**What it does:**
1. Checks if review is needed (skips closed, draft, trivial, or already-reviewed PRs)
2. Gathers relevant CLAUDE.md guideline files from the repository
3. Summarizes the pull request changes
4. Launches 4 parallel agents to independently review:
   - **Agents #1 & #2**: Audit for CLAUDE.md compliance
   - **Agent #3**: Scan for obvious bugs in changes
   - **Agent #4**: Analyze git blame/history for context-based issues
5. Scores each issue 0-100 for confidence level
6. Filters out issues below 80 confidence threshold
7. Posts review comment with high-confidence issues only

**Usage:**
```bash
/code-review
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# On a PR branch, run:
/code-review

# Claude will:
# - Launch 4 review agents in parallel
# - Score each issue for confidence
# - Post comment with issues ≥80 confidence
# - Skip posting if no high-confidence issues found
```

**Features:**
- Multiple independent agents for comprehensive review
- Confidence-based scoring reduces false positives (threshold: 80)
- CLAUDE.md compliance checking with explicit guideline verification
- Bug detection focused on changes (not pre-existing issues)
- Historical context analysis via git blame
- Automatic skipping of closed, draft, or already-reviewed PRs
- Links directly to code with full SHA and line ranges

**Review comment format:**
```markdown
## Code review

Found 3 issues:

1. Missing error handling for OAuth callback (CLAUDE.md says "Always handle OAuth errors")

https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/abc123.../src/auth.ts#L67-L72

2. Memory leak: OAuth state not cleaned up (bug due to missing cleanup in finally block)

https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/abc123.../src/auth.ts#L88-L95

3. Inconsistent naming pattern (src/conventions/CLAUDE.md says "Use camelCase for functions")

https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/abc123.../src/utils.ts#L23-L28
```

**Confidence scoring:**
- **0**: Not confident, false positive
- **25**: Somewhat confident, might be real
- **50**: Moderately confident, real but minor
- **75**: Highly confident, real and important
- **100**: Absolutely certain, definitely real

**False positives filtered:**
- Pre-existing issues not introduced in PR
- Code that looks like a bug but isn't
- Pedantic nitpicks
- Issues linters will catch
- General quality issues (unless in CLAUDE.md)
- Issues with lint ignore comments

## Installation

This plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. The command is automatically available when using Claude Code.

## Best Practices

### Using `/code-review`
- Maintain clear CLAUDE.md files for better compliance checking
- Trust the 80+ confidence threshold - false positives are filtered
- Run on all non-trivial pull requests
- Review agent findings as a starting point for human review
- Update CLAUDE.md based on recurring review patterns

### When to use
- All pull requests with meaningful changes
- PRs touching critical code paths
- PRs from multiple contributors
- PRs where guideline compliance matters

### When not to use
- Closed or draft PRs (automatically skipped anyway)
- Trivial automated PRs (automatically skipped)
- Urgent hotfixes requiring immediate merge
- PRs already reviewed (automatically skipped)

## Workflow Integration

### Standard PR review workflow:
```bash
# Create PR with changes
/code-review

# Review the automated feedback
# Make any necessary fixes
# Merge when ready
```

### As part of CI/CD:
```bash
# Trigger on PR creation or update
# Automatically posts review comments
# Skip if review already exists
```

## Requirements

- Git repository with GitHub integration
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- CLAUDE.md files (optional but recommended for guideline checking)

## Troubleshooting

### Review takes too long

**Issue**: Agents are slow on large PRs

**Solution**:
- Normal for large changes - agents run in parallel
- 4 independent agents ensure thoroughness
- Consider splitting large PRs into smaller ones

### Too many false positives

**Issue**: Review flags issues that aren't real

**Solution**:
- Default threshold is 80 (already filters most false positives)
- Make CLAUDE.md more specific about what matters
- Consider if the flagged issue is actually valid

### No review comment posted

**Issue**: `/code-review` runs but no comment appears

**Solution**:
Check if:
- PR is closed (reviews skipped)
- PR is draft (reviews skipped)
- PR is trivial/automated (reviews skipped)
- PR already has review (reviews skipped)
- No issues scored ≥80 (no comment needed)

### Link formatting broken

**Issue**: Code links don't render correctly in GitHub

**Solution**:
Links must follow this exact format:
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/[full-sha]/path/file.ext#L[start]-L[end]
```
- Must use full SHA (not abbreviated)
- Must use `#L` notation
- Must include line range with at least 1 line of context

### GitHub CLI not working

**Issue**: `gh` commands fail

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Verify repository has GitHub remote

## Tips

- **Write specific CLAUDE.md files**: Clear guidelines = better reviews
- **Include context in PRs**: Helps agents understand intent
- **Use confidence scores**: Issues ≥80 are usually correct
- **Iterate on guidelines**: Update CLAUDE.md based on patterns
- **Review automatically**: Set up as part of PR workflow
- **Trust the filtering**: Threshold prevents noise

## Configuration

### Adjusting confidence threshold

The default threshold is 80. To adjust, modify the command file at `commands/code-review.md`:
```markdown
Filter out any issues with a score less than 80.
```

Change `80` to your preferred threshold (0-100).

### Customizing review focus

Edit `commands/code-review.md` to add or modify agent tasks:
- Add security-focused agents
- Add performance analysis agents
- Add accessibility checking agents
- Add documentation quality checks

## Technical Details

### Agent architecture
- **2x CLAUDE.md compliance agents**: Redundancy for guideline checks
- **1x bug detector**: Focused on obvious bugs in changes only
- **1x history analyzer**: Context from git blame and history
- **Nx confidence scorers**: One per issue for independent scoring

### Scoring system
- Each issue independently scored 0-100
- Scoring considers evidence strength and verification
- Threshold (default 80) filters low-confidence issues
- For CLAUDE.md issues: verifies guideline explicitly mentions it

### GitHub integration
Uses `gh` CLI for:
- Viewing PR details and diffs
- Fetching repository data
- Reading git blame and history
- Posting review comments

Provide a code review for the given pull request.

To do this, follow these steps precisely:

1. Use a Haiku agent to check if the pull request (a) is closed, (b) is a draft, (c) does not need a code review (eg. because it is an automated pull request, or is very simple and obviously ok), or (d) already has a code review from you from earlier. If so, do not proceed.
2. Use another Haiku agent to give you a list of file paths to (but not the contents of) any relevant CLAUDE.md files from the codebase: the root CLAUDE.md file (if one exists), as well as any CLAUDE.md files in the directories whose files the pull request modified
3. Use a Haiku agent to view the pull request, and ask the agent to return a summary of the change
4. Then, launch 5 parallel Sonnet agents to independently code review the change. The agents should do the following, then return a list of issues and the reason each issue was flagged (eg. CLAUDE.md adherence, bug, historical git context, etc.):
   a. Agent #1: Audit the changes to make sure they compily with the CLAUDE.md. Note that CLAUDE.md is guidance for Claude as it writes code, so not all instructions will be applicable during code review.
   b. Agent #2: Read the file changes in the pull request, then do a shallow scan for obvious bugs. Avoid reading extra context beyond the changes, focusing just on the changes themselves. Focus on large bugs, and avoid small issues and nitpicks. Ignore likely false positives.
   c. Agent #3: Read the git blame and history of the code modified, to identify any bugs in light of that historical context
   d. Agent #4: Read previous pull requests that touched these files, and check for any comments on those pull requests that may also apply to the current pull request.
   e. Agent #5: Read code comments in the modified files, and make sure the changes in the pull request comply with any guidance in the comments.
5. For each issue found in #4, launch a parallel Haiku agent that takes the PR, issue description, and list of CLAUDE.md files (from step 2), and returns a score to indicate the agent's level of confidence for whether the issue is real or false positive. To do that, the agent should score each issue on a scale from 0-100, indicating its level of confidence. For issues that were flagged due to CLAUDE.md instructions, the agent should double check that the CLAUDE.md actually calls out that issue specifically. The scale is (give this rubric to the agent verbatim):
   a. 0: Not confident at all. This is a false positive that doesn't stand up to light scrutiny, or is a pre-existing issue.
   b. 25: Somewhat confident. This might be a real issue, but may also be a false positive. The agent wasn't able to verify that it's a real issue. If the issue is stylistic, it is one that was not explicitly called out in the relevant CLAUDE.md.
   c. 50: Moderately confident. The agent was able to verify this is a real issue, but it might be a nitpick or not happen very often in practice. Relative to the rest of the PR, it's not very important.
   d. 75: Highly confident. The agent double checked the issue, and verified that it is very likely it is a real issue that will be hit in practice. The existing approach in the PR is insufficient. The issue is very important and will directly impact the code's functionality, or it is an issue that is directly mentioned in the relevant CLAUDE.md.
   e. 100: Absolutely certain. The agent double checked the issue, and confirmed that it is definitely a real issue, that will happen frequently in practice. The evidence directly confirms this.
6. Filter out any issues with a score less than 80. If there are no issues that meet this criteria, do not proceed.
7. Use a Haiku agent to repeat the eligibility check from #1, to make sure that the pull request is still eligible for code review.
8. Finally, use the gh bash command to comment back on the pull request with the result. When writing your comment, keep in mind to:
   a. Keep your output brief
   b. Avoid emojis
   c. Link and cite relevant code, files, and URLs

Examples of false positives, for steps 4 and 5:

- Pre-existing issues
- Something that looks like a bug but is not actually a bug
- Pedantic nitpicks that a senior engineer wouldn't call out
- Issues that a linter, typechecker, or compiler would catch (eg. missing or incorrect imports, type errors, broken tests, formatting issues, pedantic style issues like newlines). No need to run these build steps yourself -- it is safe to assume that they will be run separately as part of CI.
- General code quality issues (eg. lack of test coverage, general security issues, poor documentation), unless explicitly required in CLAUDE.md
- Issues that are called out in CLAUDE.md, but explicitly silenced in the code (eg. due to a lint ignore comment)
- Changes in functionality that are likely intentional or are directly related to the broader change
- Real issues, but on lines that the user did not modify in their pull request

Notes:

- Do not check build signal or attempt to build or typecheck the app. These will run separately, and are not relevant to your code review.
- Use `gh` to interact with Github (eg. to fetch a pull request, or to create inline comments), rather than web fetch
- Make a todo list first
- You must cite and link each bug (eg. if referring to a CLAUDE.md, you must link it)
- For your final comment, follow the following format precisely (assuming for this example that you found 3 issues):

---

# Commit Commands Plugin

Streamline your git workflow with simple commands for committing, pushing, and creating pull requests.

## Overview

The Commit Commands Plugin automates common git operations, reducing context switching and manual command execution. Instead of running multiple git commands, use a single slash command to handle your entire workflow.

## Commands

### `/commit`

Creates a git commit with an automatically generated commit message based on staged and unstaged changes.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes current git status
2. Reviews both staged and unstaged changes
3. Examines recent commit messages to match your repository's style
4. Drafts an appropriate commit message
5. Stages relevant files
6. Creates the commit

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make some changes to your code
# Then simply run:
/commit

# Claude will:
# - Review your changes
# - Stage the files
# - Create a commit with an appropriate message
# - Show you the commit status
```

**Features:**
- Automatically drafts commit messages that match your repo's style
- Follows conventional commit practices
- Avoids committing files with secrets (.env, credentials.json)
- Includes Claude Code attribution in commit message

### `/commit-push-pr`

Complete workflow command that commits, pushes, and creates a pull request in one step.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a new branch (if currently on main)
2. Stages and commits changes with an appropriate message
3. Pushes the branch to origin
4. Creates a pull request using `gh pr create`
5. Provides the PR URL

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit-push-pr
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make your changes
# Then run:
/commit-push-pr

# Claude will:
# - Create a feature branch (if needed)
# - Commit your changes
# - Push to remote
# - Open a PR with summary and test plan
# - Give you the PR URL to review
```

**Features:**
- Analyzes all commits in the branch (not just the latest)
- Creates comprehensive PR descriptions with:
  - Summary of changes (1-3 bullet points)
  - Test plan checklist
  - Claude Code attribution
- Handles branch creation automatically
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must have a remote named `origin`

### `/clean_gone`

Cleans up local branches that have been deleted from the remote repository.

**What it does:**
1. Lists all local branches to identify [gone] status
2. Identifies and removes worktrees associated with [gone] branches
3. Deletes all branches marked as [gone]
4. Provides feedback on removed branches

**Usage:**
```bash
/clean_gone
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# After PRs are merged and remote branches are deleted
/clean_gone

# Claude will:
# - Find all branches marked as [gone]
# - Remove any associated worktrees
# - Delete the stale local branches
# - Report what was cleaned up
```

**Features:**
- Handles both regular branches and worktree branches
- Safely removes worktrees before deleting branches
- Shows clear feedback about what was removed
- Reports if no cleanup was needed

**When to use:**
- After merging and deleting remote branches
- When your local branch list is cluttered with stale branches
- During regular repository maintenance

## Installation

This plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. The commands are automatically available when using Claude Code.

## Best Practices

### Using `/commit`
- Review the staged changes before committing
- Let Claude analyze your changes and match your repo's commit style
- Trust the automated message, but verify it's accurate
- Use for routine commits during development

### Using `/commit-push-pr`
- Use when you're ready to create a PR
- Ensure all your changes are complete and tested
- Claude will analyze the full branch history for the PR description
- Review the PR description and edit if needed
- Use when you want to minimize context switching

### Using `/clean_gone`
- Run periodically to keep your branch list clean
- Especially useful after merging multiple PRs
- Safe to run - only removes branches already deleted remotely
- Helps maintain a tidy local repository

## Workflow Integration

### Quick commit workflow:
```bash
# Write code
/commit
# Continue development
```

### Feature branch workflow:
```bash
# Develop feature across multiple commits
/commit  # First commit
# More changes
/commit  # Second commit
# Ready to create PR
/commit-push-pr
```

### Maintenance workflow:
```bash
# After several PRs are merged
/clean_gone
# Clean workspace ready for next feature
```

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and configured
- For `/commit-push-pr`: GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must be a git repository with a remote

## Troubleshooting

### `/commit` creates empty commit

**Issue**: No changes to commit

**Solution**:
- Ensure you have unstaged or staged changes
- Run `git status` to verify changes exist

### `/commit-push-pr` fails to create PR

**Issue**: `gh pr create` command fails

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Ensure repository has a GitHub remote

### `/clean_gone` doesn't find branches

**Issue**: No branches marked as [gone]

**Solution**:
- Run `git fetch --prune` to update remote tracking
- Branches must be deleted from the remote to show as [gone]

## Tips

- **Combine with other tools**: Use `/commit` during development, then `/commit-push-pr` when ready
- **Let Claude draft messages**: The commit message analysis learns from your repo's style
- **Regular cleanup**: Run `/clean_gone` weekly to maintain a clean branch list
- **Review before pushing**: Always review the commit message and changes before pushing

description: Cleans up all git branches marked as [gone] (branches that have been deleted on the remote but still exist locally), including removing associated worktrees.
---

## Your Task

You need to execute the following bash commands to clean up stale local branches that have been deleted from the remote repository.

## Commands to Execute

1. **First, list branches to identify any with [gone] status**
   Execute this command:
   ```bash
   git branch -v
   ```
   
   Note: Branches with a '+' prefix have associated worktrees and must have their worktrees removed before deletion.

2. **Next, identify worktrees that need to be removed for [gone] branches**
   Execute this command:
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```

3. **Finally, remove worktrees and delete [gone] branches (handles both regular and worktree branches)**
   Execute this command:
   ```bash
   # Process all [gone] branches, removing '+' prefix if present
   git branch -v | grep '\[gone\]' | sed 's/^[+* ]//' | awk '{print $1}' | while read branch; do
     echo "Processing branch: $branch"
     # Find and remove worktree if it exists
     worktree=$(git worktree list | grep "\\[$branch\\]" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ ! -z "$worktree" ] && [ "$worktree" != "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" ]; then
       echo "  Removing worktree: $worktree"
       git worktree remove --force "$worktree"
     fi
     # Delete the branch
     echo "  Deleting branch: $branch"
     git branch -D "$branch"
   done
   ```

## Expected Behavior

After executing these commands, you will:

- See a list of all local branches with their status
- Identify and remove any worktrees associated with [gone] branches
- Delete all branches marked as [gone]
- Provide feedback on which worktrees and branches were removed

If no branches are marked as [gone], report that no cleanup was needed.

# Feature Development Plugin

A comprehensive, structured workflow for feature development with specialized agents for codebase exploration, architecture design, and quality review.

## Overview

The Feature Development Plugin provides a systematic 7-phase approach to building new features. Instead of jumping straight into code, it guides you through understanding the codebase, asking clarifying questions, designing architecture, and ensuring quality—resulting in better-designed features that integrate seamlessly with your existing code.

## Philosophy

Building features requires more than just writing code. You need to:
- **Understand the codebase** before making changes
- **Ask questions** to clarify ambiguous requirements
- **Design thoughtfully** before implementing
- **Review for quality** after building

This plugin embeds these practices into a structured workflow that runs automatically when you use the `/feature-dev` command.

## Command: `/feature-dev`

Launches a guided feature development workflow with 7 distinct phases.

**Usage:**
```bash
/feature-dev Add user authentication with OAuth
```

Or simply:
```bash
/feature-dev
```

The command will guide you through the entire process interactively.

## The 7-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Understand what needs to be built

**What happens:**
- Clarifies the feature request if it's unclear
- Asks what problem you're solving
- Identifies constraints and requirements
- Summarizes understanding and confirms with you

**Example:**
```
You: /feature-dev Add caching
Claude: Let me understand what you need...
        - What should be cached? (API responses, computed values, etc.)
        - What are your performance requirements?
        - Do you have a preferred caching solution?
```

### Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal**: Understand relevant existing code and patterns

**What happens:**
- Launches 2-3 `code-explorer` agents in parallel
- Each agent explores different aspects (similar features, architecture, UI patterns)
- Agents return comprehensive analyses with key files to read
- Claude reads all identified files to build deep understanding
- Presents comprehensive summary of findings

**Agents launched:**
- "Find features similar to [feature] and trace implementation"
- "Map the architecture and abstractions for [area]"
- "Analyze current implementation of [related feature]"

**Example output:**
```
Found similar features:
- User authentication (src/auth/): Uses JWT tokens, middleware pattern
- Session management (src/session/): Redis-backed, 24hr expiry
- API security (src/api/middleware/): Rate limiting, CORS

Key files to understand:
- src/auth/AuthService.ts:45 - Core authentication logic
- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts:12 - Request authentication
- src/config/security.ts:8 - Security configuration
```

### Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

**Goal**: Fill in gaps and resolve all ambiguities

**What happens:**
- Reviews codebase findings and feature request
- Identifies underspecified aspects:
  - Edge cases
  - Error handling
  - Integration points
  - Backward compatibility
  - Performance needs
- Presents all questions in an organized list
- **Waits for your answers before proceeding**

**Example:**
```
Before designing the architecture, I need to clarify:

1. OAuth provider: Which OAuth providers? (Google, GitHub, custom?)
2. User data: Store OAuth tokens or just user profile?
3. Existing auth: Replace current auth or add alongside?
4. Sessions: Integrate with existing session management?
5. Error handling: How to handle OAuth failures?
```

**Critical**: This phase ensures nothing is ambiguous before design begins.

### Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Goal**: Design multiple implementation approaches

**What happens:**
- Launches 2-3 `code-architect` agents with different focuses:
  - **Minimal changes**: Smallest change, maximum reuse
  - **Clean architecture**: Maintainability, elegant abstractions
  - **Pragmatic balance**: Speed + quality
- Reviews all approaches
- Forms opinion on which fits best for this task
- Presents comparison with trade-offs and recommendation
- **Asks which approach you prefer**

**Example output:**
```
I've designed 3 approaches:

Approach 1: Minimal Changes
- Extend existing AuthService with OAuth methods
- Add new OAuth routes to existing auth router
- Minimal refactoring required
Pros: Fast, low risk
Cons: Couples OAuth to existing auth, harder to test

Approach 2: Clean Architecture
- New OAuthService with dedicated interface
- Separate OAuth router and middleware
- Refactor AuthService to use common interface
Pros: Clean separation, testable, maintainable
Cons: More files, more refactoring

Approach 3: Pragmatic Balance
- New OAuthProvider abstraction
- Integrate into existing AuthService
- Minimal refactoring, good boundaries
Pros: Balanced complexity and cleanliness
Cons: Some coupling remains

Recommendation: Approach 3 - gives you clean boundaries without
excessive refactoring, and fits your existing architecture well.

Which approach would you like to use?
```

### Phase 5: Implementation

**Goal**: Build the feature

**What happens:**
- **Waits for explicit approval** before starting
- Reads all relevant files identified in previous phases
- Implements following chosen architecture
- Follows codebase conventions strictly
- Writes clean, well-documented code
- Updates todos as progress is made

**Notes:**
- Implementation only starts after you approve
- Follows patterns discovered in Phase 2
- Uses architecture designed in Phase 4
- Continuously tracks progress

### Phase 6: Quality Review

**Goal**: Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, and functionally correct

**What happens:**
- Launches 3 `code-reviewer` agents in parallel with different focuses:
  - **Simplicity/DRY/Elegance**: Code quality and maintainability
  - **Bugs/Correctness**: Functional correctness and logic errors
  - **Conventions/Abstractions**: Project standards and patterns
- Consolidates findings
- Identifies highest severity issues
- **Presents findings and asks what you want to do**:
  - Fix now
  - Fix later
  - Proceed as-is
- Addresses issues based on your decision

**Example output:**
```
Code Review Results:

High Priority Issues:
1. Missing error handling in OAuth callback (src/auth/oauth.ts:67)
2. Memory leak: OAuth state not cleaned up (src/auth/oauth.ts:89)

Medium Priority:
1. Could simplify token refresh logic (src/auth/oauth.ts:120)
2. Consider extracting OAuth config validation

All tests pass. Code follows project conventions.

What would you like to do?
```

### Phase 7: Summary

**Goal**: Document what was accomplished

**What happens:**
- Marks all todos complete
- Summarizes:
  - What was built
  - Key decisions made
  - Files modified
  - Suggested next steps

**Example:**
```
Feature Complete: OAuth Authentication

What was built:
- OAuth provider abstraction supporting Google and GitHub
- OAuth routes and middleware integrated with existing auth
- Token refresh and session integration
- Error handling for all OAuth flows

Key decisions:
- Used pragmatic approach with OAuthProvider abstraction
- Integrated with existing session management
- Added OAuth state to prevent CSRF

Files modified:
- src/auth/OAuthProvider.ts (new)
- src/auth/AuthService.ts
- src/routes/auth.ts
- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts

Suggested next steps:
- Add tests for OAuth flows
- Add more OAuth providers (Microsoft, Apple)
- Update documentation
```

## Agents

### `code-explorer`

**Purpose**: Deeply analyzes existing codebase features by tracing execution paths

**Focus areas:**
- Entry points and call chains
- Data flow and transformations
- Architecture layers and patterns
- Dependencies and integrations
- Implementation details

**When triggered:**
- Automatically in Phase 2
- Can be invoked manually when exploring code

**Output:**
- Entry points with file:line references
- Step-by-step execution flow
- Key components and responsibilities
- Architecture insights
- List of essential files to read

### `code-architect`

**Purpose**: Designs feature architectures and implementation blueprints

**Focus areas:**
- Codebase pattern analysis
- Architecture decisions
- Component design
- Implementation roadmap
- Data flow and build sequence

**When triggered:**
- Automatically in Phase 4
- Can be invoked manually for architecture design

**Output:**
- Patterns and conventions found
- Architecture decision with rationale
- Complete component design
- Implementation map with specific files
- Build sequence with phases

### `code-reviewer`

**Purpose**: Reviews code for bugs, quality issues, and project conventions

**Focus areas:**
- Project guideline compliance (CLAUDE.md)
- Bug detection
- Code quality issues
- Confidence-based filtering (only reports high-confidence issues ≥80)

**When triggered:**
- Automatically in Phase 6
- Can be invoked manually after writing code

**Output:**
- Critical issues (confidence 75-100)
- Important issues (confidence 50-74)
- Specific fixes with file:line references
- Project guideline references

## Usage Patterns

### Full workflow (recommended for new features):
```bash
/feature-dev Add rate limiting to API endpoints
```

Let the workflow guide you through all 7 phases.

### Manual agent invocation:

**Explore a feature:**
```
"Launch code-explorer to trace how authentication works"
```

**Design architecture:**
```
"Launch code-architect to design the caching layer"
```

**Review code:**
```
"Launch code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use the full workflow for complex features**: The 7 phases ensure thorough planning
2. **Answer clarifying questions thoughtfully**: Phase 3 prevents future confusion
3. **Choose architecture deliberately**: Phase 4 gives you options for a reason
4. **Don't skip code review**: Phase 6 catches issues before they reach production
5. **Read the suggested files**: Phase 2 identifies key files—read them to understand context

## When to Use This Plugin

**Use for:**
- New features that touch multiple files
- Features requiring architectural decisions
- Complex integrations with existing code
- Features where requirements are somewhat unclear

**Don't use for:**
- Single-line bug fixes
- Trivial changes
- Well-defined, simple tasks
- Urgent hotfixes

## Requirements

- Claude Code installed
- Git repository (for code review)
- Project with existing codebase (workflow assumes existing code to learn from)

## Troubleshooting

### Agents take too long

**Issue**: Code exploration or architecture agents are slow

**Solution**:
- This is normal for large codebases
- Agents run in parallel when possible
- The thoroughness pays off in better understanding

### Too many clarifying questions

**Issue**: Phase 3 asks too many questions

**Solution**:
- Be more specific in your initial feature request
- Provide context about constraints upfront
- Say "whatever you think is best" if truly no preference

### Architecture options overwhelming

**Issue**: Too many architecture options in Phase 4

**Solution**:
- Trust the recommendation—it's based on codebase analysis
- If still unsure, ask for more explanation
- Pick the pragmatic option when in doubt

## Tips

- **Be specific in your feature request**: More detail = fewer clarifying questions
- **Trust the process**: Each phase builds on the previous one
- **Review agent outputs**: Agents provide valuable insights about your codebase
- **Don't skip phases**: Each phase serves a purpose
- **Use for learning**: The exploration phase teaches you about your own codebase

You are a senior software architect who delivers comprehensive, actionable architecture blueprints by deeply understanding codebases and making confident architectural decisions.

## Core Process

**1. Codebase Pattern Analysis**
Extract existing patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions. Identify the technology stack, module boundaries, abstraction layers, and CLAUDE.md guidelines. Find similar features to understand established approaches.

**2. Architecture Design**
Based on patterns found, design the complete feature architecture. Make decisive choices - pick one approach and commit. Ensure seamless integration with existing code. Design for testability, performance, and maintainability.

**3. Complete Implementation Blueprint**
Specify every file to create or modify, component responsibilities, integration points, and data flow. Break implementation into clear phases with specific tasks.

## Output Guidance

Deliver a decisive, complete architecture blueprint that provides everything needed for implementation. Include:

- **Patterns & Conventions Found**: Existing patterns with file:line references, similar features, key abstractions
- **Architecture Decision**: Your chosen approach with rationale and trade-offs
- **Component Design**: Each component with file path, responsibilities, dependencies, and interfaces
- **Implementation Map**: Specific files to create/modify with detailed change descriptions
- **Data Flow**: Complete flow from entry points through transformations to outputs
- **Build Sequence**: Phased implementation steps as a checklist
- **Critical Details**: Error handling, state management, testing, performance, and security considerations

Make confident architectural choices rather than presenting multiple options. Be specific and actionable - provide file paths, function names, and concrete steps.

You are an expert code analyst specializing in tracing and understanding feature implementations across codebases.

## Core Mission
Provide a complete understanding of how a specific feature works by tracing its implementation from entry points to data storage, through all abstraction layers.

## Analysis Approach

**1. Feature Discovery**
- Find entry points (APIs, UI components, CLI commands)
- Locate core implementation files
- Map feature boundaries and configuration

**2. Code Flow Tracing**
- Follow call chains from entry to output
- Trace data transformations at each step
- Identify all dependencies and integrations
- Document state changes and side effects

**3. Architecture Analysis**
- Map abstraction layers (presentation → business logic → data)
- Identify design patterns and architectural decisions
- Document interfaces between components
- Note cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, caching)

**4. Implementation Details**
- Key algorithms and data structures
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance considerations
- Technical debt or improvement areas

## Output Guidance

Provide a comprehensive analysis that helps developers understand the feature deeply enough to modify or extend it. Include:

- Entry points with file:line references
- Step-by-step execution flow with data transformations
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Architecture insights: patterns, layers, design decisions
- Dependencies (external and internal)
- Observations about strengths, issues, or opportunities
- List of files that you think are absolutely essential to get an understanding of the topic in question

Structure your response for maximum clarity and usefulness. Always include specific file paths and line numbers.

---

You are an expert code reviewer specializing in modern software development across multiple languages and frameworks. Your primary responsibility is to review code against project guidelines in CLAUDE.md with high precision to minimize false positives.

## Review Scope

By default, review unstaged changes from `git diff`. The user may specify different files or scope to review.

## Core Review Responsibilities

**Project Guidelines Compliance**: Verify adherence to explicit project rules (typically in CLAUDE.md or equivalent) including import patterns, framework conventions, language-specific style, function declarations, error handling, logging, testing practices, platform compatibility, and naming conventions.

**Bug Detection**: Identify actual bugs that will impact functionality - logic errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and performance problems.

**Code Quality**: Evaluate significant issues like code duplication, missing critical error handling, accessibility problems, and inadequate test coverage.

## Confidence Scoring

Rate each potential issue on a scale from 0-100:

- **0**: Not confident at all. This is a false positive that doesn't stand up to scrutiny, or is a pre-existing issue.
- **25**: Somewhat confident. This might be a real issue, but may also be a false positive. If stylistic, it wasn't explicitly called out in project guidelines.
- **50**: Moderately confident. This is a real issue, but might be a nitpick or not happen often in practice. Not very important relative to the rest of the changes.
- **75**: Highly confident. Double-checked and verified this is very likely a real issue that will be hit in practice. The existing approach is insufficient. Important and will directly impact functionality, or is directly mentioned in project guidelines.
- **100**: Absolutely certain. Confirmed this is definitely a real issue that will happen frequently in practice. The evidence directly confirms this.

**Only report issues with confidence ≥ 80.** Focus on issues that truly matter - quality over quantity.

## Output Guidance

Start by clearly stating what you're reviewing. For each high-confidence issue, provide:

- Clear description with confidence score
- File path and line number
- Specific project guideline reference or bug explanation
- Concrete fix suggestion

Group issues by severity (Critical vs Important). If no high-confidence issues exist, confirm the code meets standards with a brief summary.

Structure your response for maximum actionability - developers should know exactly what to fix and why.

# Feature Development

You are helping a developer implement a new feature. Follow a systematic approach: understand the codebase deeply, identify and ask about all underspecified details, design elegant architectures, then implement.

## Core Principles

- **Ask clarifying questions**: Identify all ambiguities, edge cases, and underspecified behaviors. Ask specific, concrete questions rather than making assumptions. Wait for user answers before proceeding with implementation. Ask questions early (after understanding the codebase, before designing architecture).
- **Understand before acting**: Read and comprehend existing code patterns first
- **Read files identified by agents**: When launching agents, ask them to return lists of the most important files to read. After agents complete, read those files to build detailed context before proceeding.
- **Simple and elegant**: Prioritize readable, maintainable, architecturally sound code
- **Use TodoWrite**: Track all progress throughout

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Understand what needs to be built

Initial request: $ARGUMENTS

**Actions**:
1. Create todo list with all phases
2. If feature unclear, ask user for:
   - What problem are they solving?
   - What should the feature do?
   - Any constraints or requirements?
3. Summarize understanding and confirm with user

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal**: Understand relevant existing code and patterns at both high and low levels

**Actions**:
1. Launch 2-3 code-explorer agents in parallel. Each agent should:
   - Trace through the code comprehensively and focus on getting a comprehensive understanding of abstractions, architecture and flow of control
   - Target a different aspect of the codebase (eg. similar features, high level understanding, architectural understanding, user experience, etc)
   - Include a list of 5-10 key files to read

   **Example agent prompts**:
   - "Find features similar to [feature] and trace through their implementation comprehensively"
   - "Map the architecture and abstractions for [feature area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Analyze the current implementation of [existing feature/area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Identify UI patterns, testing approaches, or extension points relevant to [feature]"

2. Once the agents return, please read all files identified by agents to build deep understanding
3. Present comprehensive summary of findings and patterns discovered

---

## Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

**Goal**: Fill in gaps and resolve all ambiguities before designing

**CRITICAL**: This is one of the most important phases. DO NOT SKIP.

**Actions**:
1. Review the codebase findings and original feature request
2. Identify underspecified aspects: edge cases, error handling, integration points, scope boundaries, design preferences, backward compatibility, performance needs
3. **Present all questions to the user in a clear, organized list**
4. **Wait for answers before proceeding to architecture design**

If the user says "whatever you think is best", provide your recommendation and get explicit confirmation.

---

## Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Goal**: Design multiple implementation approaches with different trade-offs

**Actions**:
1. Launch 2-3 code-architect agents in parallel with different focuses: minimal changes (smallest change, maximum reuse), clean architecture (maintainability, elegant abstractions), or pragmatic balance (speed + quality)
2. Review all approaches and form your opinion on which fits best for this specific task (consider: small fix vs large feature, urgency, complexity, team context)
3. Present to user: brief summary of each approach, trade-offs comparison, **your recommendation with reasoning**, concrete implementation differences
4. **Ask user which approach they prefer**

---

## Phase 5: Implementation

**Goal**: Build the feature

**DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**

**Actions**:
1. Wait for explicit user approval
2. Read all relevant files identified in previous phases
3. Implement following chosen architecture
4. Follow codebase conventions strictly
5. Write clean, well-documented code
6. Update todos as you progress

---

## Phase 6: Quality Review

**Goal**: Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, easy to read, and functionally correct

**Actions**:
1. Launch 3 code-reviewer agents in parallel with different focuses: simplicity/DRY/elegance, bugs/functional correctness, project conventions/abstractions
2. Consolidate findings and identify highest severity issues that you recommend fixing
3. **Present findings to user and ask what they want to do** (fix now, fix later, or proceed as-is)
4. Address issues based on user decision

---

## Phase 7: Summary

**Goal**: Document what was accomplished

**Actions**:
1. Mark all todos complete
2. Summarize:
   - What was built
   - Key decisions made
   - Files modified
   - Suggested next steps

license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt
---

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

# Learning Style Plugin

This plugin combines the unshipped Learning output style with explanatory functionality as a SessionStart hook.

**Note:** This plugin differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating all functionality from the [explanatory-output-style plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/explanatory-output-style), providing both interactive learning and educational insights.

WARNING: Do not install this plugin unless you are fine with incurring the token cost of this plugin's additional instructions and the interactive nature of learning mode.

## What it does

When enabled, this plugin automatically adds instructions at the start of each session that encourage Claude to:

1. **Learning Mode:** Engage you in active learning by requesting meaningful code contributions at decision points
2. **Explanatory Mode:** Provide educational insights about implementation choices and codebase patterns

Instead of implementing everything automatically, Claude will:

1. Identify opportunities where you can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code
2. Focus on business logic and design choices where your input truly matters
3. Prepare the context and location for your contribution
4. Explain trade-offs and guide your implementation
5. Provide educational insights before and after writing code

## How it works

The plugin uses a SessionStart hook to inject additional context into every session. This context instructs Claude to adopt an interactive teaching approach where you actively participate in writing key parts of the code.

## When Claude requests contributions

Claude will ask you to write code for:
- Business logic with multiple valid approaches
- Error handling strategies
- Algorithm implementation choices
- Data structure decisions
- User experience decisions
- Design patterns and architecture choices

## When Claude won't request contributions

Claude will implement directly:
- Boilerplate or repetitive code
- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices
- Configuration or setup code
- Simple CRUD operations

## Example interaction

**Claude:** I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout?

In `auth/middleware.ts`, implement the `handleSessionTimeout()` function to define the timeout behavior.

Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.

**You:** [Write 5-10 lines implementing your preferred approach]

## Educational insights

In addition to interactive learning, Claude will provide educational insights about implementation choices using this format:

```
`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
[2-3 key educational points about the codebase or implementation]
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
```

These insights focus on:
- Specific implementation choices for your codebase
- Patterns and conventions in your code
- Trade-offs and design decisions
- Codebase-specific details rather than general programming concepts

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin activates automatically at the start of every session. No additional configuration is needed.

## Migration from Output Styles

This plugin combines the unshipped "Learning" output style with the deprecated "Explanatory" output style. It provides an interactive learning experience where you actively contribute code at meaningful decision points, while also receiving educational insights about implementation choices.

If you previously used the explanatory-output-style plugin, this learning plugin includes all of that functionality plus interactive learning features.

This SessionStart hook pattern is roughly equivalent to CLAUDE.md, but it is more flexible and allows for distribution through plugins.

## Managing changes

- Disable the plugin - keep the code installed on your device
- Uninstall the plugin - remove the code from your device
- Update the plugin - create a local copy of this plugin to personalize it
  - Hint: Ask Claude to read https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins.md and set it up for you!

## Philosophy

Learning by doing is more effective than passive observation. This plugin transforms your interaction with Claude from "watch and learn" to "build and understand," ensuring you develop practical skills through hands-on coding of meaningful logic.

Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\n\nWhen requesting:\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\n\n## Example Request Pattern\n\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\n\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\n\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\n\n## Balance\n\nDon't request contributions for:\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\n- Configuration or setup code\n- Simple CRUD operations\n\nDo request contributions when:\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\n\n## Explanatory Mode\n\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\n\n### Insights\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\n\n\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n[2-3 key educational points]\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\"\n\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase. Focus on interesting insights specific to the codebase or the code you just wrote, rather than general programming concepts. Provide insights as you write code, not just at the end."

```

**Note**: This agent preserves functionality while improving code structure and maintainability.

## Usage Patterns

### Individual Agent Usage

Simply ask questions that match an agent's focus area, and Claude will automatically trigger the appropriate agent:

```
"Can you check if the tests cover all edge cases?"
→ Triggers pr-test-analyzer

"Review the error handling in the API client"
→ Triggers silent-failure-hunter

"I've added documentation - is it accurate?"
→ Triggers comment-analyzer
```

### Comprehensive PR Review

For thorough PR review, ask for multiple aspects:

```
"I'm ready to create this PR. Please:
1. Review test coverage
2. Check for silent failures
3. Verify code comments are accurate
4. Review any new types
5. General code review"
```

This will trigger all relevant agents to analyze different aspects of your PR.

### Proactive Review

Claude may proactively use these agents based on context:

- **After writing code** → code-reviewer
- **After adding docs** → comment-analyzer
- **Before creating PR** → Multiple agents as appropriate
- **After adding types** → type-design-analyzer

## Installation

Install from your personal marketplace:

```bash
/plugins
# Find "pr-review-toolkit"
# Install
```

Or add manually to settings if needed.

## Agent Details

### Confidence Scoring

Agents provide confidence scores for their findings:

**comment-analyzer**: Identifies issues with high confidence in accuracy checks

**pr-test-analyzer**: Rates test gaps 1-10 (10 = critical, must add)

**silent-failure-hunter**: Flags severity of error handling issues

**type-design-analyzer**: Rates 4 dimensions on 1-10 scale

**code-reviewer**: Scores issues 0-100 (91-100 = critical)

**code-simplifier**: Identifies complexity and suggests simplifications

### Output Formats

All agents provide structured, actionable output:
- Clear issue identification
- Specific file and line references
- Explanation of why it's a problem
- Suggestions for improvement
- Prioritized by severity

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Agent

**Before Committing:**
- code-reviewer (general quality)
- silent-failure-hunter (if changed error handling)

**Before Creating PR:**
- pr-test-analyzer (test coverage check)
- comment-analyzer (if added/modified comments)
- type-design-analyzer (if added/modified types)
- code-reviewer (final sweep)

**After Passing Review:**
- code-simplifier (improve clarity and maintainability)

**During PR Review:**
- Any agent for specific concerns raised
- Targeted re-review after fixes

### Running Multiple Agents

You can request multiple agents to run in parallel or sequentially:

**Parallel** (faster):
```
"Run pr-test-analyzer and comment-analyzer in parallel"
```

**Sequential** (when one informs the other):
```
"First review test coverage, then check code quality"
```

## Tips

- **Be specific**: Target specific agents for focused review
- **Use proactively**: Run before creating PRs, not after
- **Address critical issues first**: Agents prioritize findings
- **Iterate**: Run again after fixes to verify
- **Don't over-use**: Focus on changed code, not entire codebase

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Triggering

**Issue**: Asked for review but agent didn't run

**Solution**:
- Be more specific in your request
- Mention the agent type explicitly
- Reference the specific concern (e.g., "test coverage")

### Agent Analyzing Wrong Files

**Issue**: Agent reviewing too much or wrong files

**Solution**:
- Specify which files to focus on
- Reference the PR number or branch
- Mention "recent changes" or "git diff"

## Integration with Workflow

This plugin works great with:
- **build-validator**: Run build/tests before review
- **Project-specific agents**: Combine with your custom agents

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Write code → **code-reviewer**
2. Fix issues → **silent-failure-hunter** (if error handling)
3. Add tests → **pr-test-analyzer**
4. Document → **comment-analyzer**
5. Review passes → **code-simplifier** (polish)
6. Create PR

name: code-reviewer
description: Use this agent when you need to review code for adherence to project guidelines, style guides, and best practices. This agent should be used proactively after writing or modifying code, especially before committing changes or creating pull requests. It will check for style violations, potential issues, and ensure code follows the established patterns in CLAUDE.md. Also the agent needs to know which files to focus on for the review. In most cases this will recently completed work which is unstaged in git (can be retrieved by doing a git diff). However there can be cases where this is different, make sure to specify this as the agent input when calling the agent. \n\nExamples:\n<example>\nContext: The user has just implemented a new feature with several TypeScript files.\nuser: "I've added the new authentication feature. Can you check if everything looks good?"\nassistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent to review your recent changes."\n<commentary>\nSince the user has completed a feature and wants validation, use the code-reviewer agent to ensure the code meets project standards.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: The assistant has just written a new utility function.\nuser: "Please create a function to validate email addresses"\nassistant: "Here's the email validation function:"\n<function call omitted for brevity>\nassistant: "Now I'll use the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent to review this implementation."\n<commentary>\nProactively use the code-reviewer agent after writing new code to catch issues early.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: The user is about to create a PR.\nuser: "I think I'm ready to create a PR for this feature"\nassistant: "Before creating the PR, I'll use the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent to ensure all code meets our standards."\n<commentary>\nProactively review code before PR creation to avoid review comments and iterations.\n</commentary>\n</example>

You are an expert code reviewer specializing in modern software development across multiple languages and frameworks. Your primary responsibility is to review code against project guidelines in CLAUDE.md with high precision to minimize false positives.

## Review Scope

By default, review unstaged changes from `git diff`. The user may specify different files or scope to review.

## Core Review Responsibilities

**Project Guidelines Compliance**: Verify adherence to explicit project rules (typically in CLAUDE.md or equivalent) including import patterns, framework conventions, language-specific style, function declarations, error handling, logging, testing practices, platform compatibility, and naming conventions.

**Bug Detection**: Identify actual bugs that will impact functionality - logic errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and performance problems.

**Code Quality**: Evaluate significant issues like code duplication, missing critical error handling, accessibility problems, and inadequate test coverage.

## Issue Confidence Scoring

Rate each issue from 0-100:

- **0-25**: Likely false positive or pre-existing issue
- **26-50**: Minor nitpick not explicitly in CLAUDE.md
- **51-75**: Valid but low-impact issue
- **76-90**: Important issue requiring attention
- **91-100**: Critical bug or explicit CLAUDE.md violation

**Only report issues with confidence ≥ 80**

## Output Format

Start by listing what you're reviewing. For each high-confidence issue provide:

- Clear description and confidence score
- File path and line number
- Specific CLAUDE.md rule or bug explanation
- Concrete fix suggestion

Group issues by severity (Critical: 90-100, Important: 80-89).

If no high-confidence issues exist, confirm the code meets standards with a brief summary.

Be thorough but filter aggressively - quality over quantity. Focus on issues that truly matter.
